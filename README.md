## clecon

A suite of functions, examples and data sets for conducting classical economic analysis, including 
- the computation of the vector of labor values, the vector of prices of production and the (scalar) uniform rates of profit
- quantifying deviation between the vector of _relative_ labor values and the vector of _relative_ prices of production

# The functions

- `ppsraffa1`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the Sraffian approach
- `ppstdint1`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the Standard Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and no unproductive industries)
- `ppstdint2`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the Standard Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and allowing for unproductive industries)
- `ppstdint3`: Compute values and prices of production for the model with capital stock using the Standard Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and no unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint1`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and no unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint2`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (wage differentials and no unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint3`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and allowing for unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint4`: Compute values and prices of production for the circulating capital model using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (wage differentials and allowing for unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint5`: Compute values and prices of production for the model with capital stock using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and no unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint6`: Compute values and prices of production for the model with capital stock using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (wage differentials and no unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint7`: Compute values and prices of production for the model with capital stock using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (uniform wage rates and allowing for unproductive industries)
- `ppnewint8`: Compute values and prices of production for the model with capital stock using the New Interpretation of Marx's labor theory of value (wage differentials and allowing for unproductive industries)
- `nonreg_tests`: Quantify deviation between relative values and relative prices of production using non-regression-based measures
- `reg_tests`: Quantify deviation between relative values and relative prices of production using regression-based measures

The output from each function is a list.
